# DataAnalysisProject

This project demonstrates **end-to-end data analysis skills** applied to real datasets covering nutrition patterns in India and global development indicators. It includes **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and visualization**. The goal is not only to uncover insights but also to show the **ability to work with messy, real-world data** and communicate results effectively.

> 🚀 **Why this project matters**  
> Understanding dietary patterns and development statistics has wide applications — from **public health** to **policy design** to **business strategy**. This project showcases the ability to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them in ways that drive decisions — the same skills needed in data science, analytics, and machine learning roles.
