# DataAnalysisProject

This project demonstrates **end-to-end data analysis skills** applied to real datasets covering nutrition patterns in India and global development indicators. It includes **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and visualization**. The goal is not only to uncover insights but also to show the **ability to work with messy, real-world data** and communicate results effectively.

> **Why this project matters**  
> Understanding dietary patterns and development statistics has wide applications — from **public health** to **policy design** to **business strategy**. This project showcases the ability to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them in ways that drive decisions — the same skills needed in data science, analytics, and machine learning roles.

## 📒 Notebook Highlights

### 🇮🇳 Indian Diet Analysis (`indian-diet.ipynb`)
- Cleaned and pre-processed a dataset (`food_impact_india.csv`) with missing values and categorical inconsistencies.  
- Performed **descriptive statistics** and **trend analysis** on dietary habits.  
- Built **visualizations** (bar charts, histograms, heatmaps) to compare nutritional components and identify consumption patterns.  
- Drew insights about the relationship between diet, sustainability, and potential health implications.  

**Skills Shown**: Data wrangling, EDA, data visualization, critical thinking in nutrition/public health contexts.

### 🌍 World Development Statistics (`project_world_dev_stats.ipynb`)
- Analyzed **global socio-economic indicators** (health, education, GDP, etc.).  
- Used **correlation analysis** and **comparative plots** to uncover relationships between development metrics.  
- Highlighted disparities between countries/regions, linking data patterns to real-world development challenges.  
- Produced professional-quality plots and clear narratives around findings.  

**Skills Shown**: Multivariate analysis, data storytelling, connecting numbers to global development insights.

💼 Together, these notebooks show the ability to:
- Handle real-world messy data,
- Extract actionable insights,
- Communicate them in a structured, professional way — highly transferable to **data science and analytics roles**.
